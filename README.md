This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The bug is explained in the bug.java file and a corrected version is provided in bugSolution.java.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an array element beyond its defined bounds. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices in loops to avoid runtime exceptions.
